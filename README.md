HOW TO PLAY
Navigate the start screen, and hit play.

P1: WASD for movement and TAB to attack. you're meant to play with your right hand over WASD
P2: Arrow Keys for movement and Period Key to attack. you're meant to play with your right hand over Arrow Keys

Both players have one attack, movement, and a jump button (mostly to show i'm using those cool rigidbodies). Attacks are one hit KOs, so mind your spacing!
